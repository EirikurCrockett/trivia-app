This is a simple triva game web app

currently still a work in progress

The technologies being used are...
```
Frontend: React.js/Next.js
Backend: Next.js
ORM: Prisma
Database: PostgreSQL 
API: https://opentdb.com/
```

I have stored the categories from https://opentdb.com/ API into my DB for ease of use. At the moment, I am just using api calls to get the data for the questions instead of storing them in my DB
